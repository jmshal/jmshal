Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jacob, a software developer from New Zealand.

I've been building things on the web for over 17 years now.

I spend most of my time writing JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Go.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to drop me a DM via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heyimjacooob) or shoot me an [email](mailto:github@jacob.dev).
