Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jacob, a 28 year old software developer from New Zealand.

I've been building things on the web for over 20 years now.

I spend most of my time writing JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Go.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to drop me a DM via [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jacob.dev) or shoot me an [email](mailto:github@jacob.dev).
